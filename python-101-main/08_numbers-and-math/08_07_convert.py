# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
num_int = 5
num_float_from_int = float(num_int)
print(num_float_from_int)

# 2) Convert a float to an int
num_float = 5.9
num_int_from_float = int(num_float)
print(num_int_from_float) 

# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
num_float = 5.3
num_int = 8

print(num_float / num_int)

# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
Mango = 35
Apple = 25
Watermelon = -10

print(Mango + Watermelon * Mango - Apple)

# What information is lost during which conversions?
# The information that it got lost during the conversations where the decimals, in the line 8,
# when we did the conversion from FLOAT to INT
